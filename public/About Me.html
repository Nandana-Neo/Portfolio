    <p> A very passionate learner and programmer. I am always ready to take on challenges and embrace the future. The technological world has never stopped to set me on fire as it keeps growing. An excellent team player and quite ambitious.</p>
    <p>I did my schooling from Holy Angel's ISC School, Pattom and Arya Central School, Pattom, Trivandrum. Since my school days, I have worked passionately to achieve success even if it meant completing a 4 pages essay.</p>
